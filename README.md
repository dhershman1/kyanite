## Why The Name Kyanite?

Because I think mineral names are cool

## Philosophy

The goal for Kyanite is to be stripped down, light weight, and intuitive. The idea is to be performant and easy to use in a functional setting, making it simple to build reusable functions in your code base with powerful and organized algorithmic pipes. Ultimately, Kyaniteâ€™s continued growth and improvement will support the growth and improvement of the JavaScript community

## Key Features

- Purely Functional - This was a main focus for the project. I wanted it to be an easy to use, functional system while also being completely pure by making use of piping and transducers to boost performance.
- Single type utility functions - Theoretically, all of the functionality is based around accepting a single data type, doing what it does, and giving you back a result, thus making it reliable, stable, and lightweight.
- Everything is curried! Setup static in one spot and then pass the rest of the dynamic data in later.
- Data last ideology

## How To

> **Note:** As of `v2.0.0` the module should be imported as just `K` instead of `kyanite`
> The unminified version of the library is no longer available as of 2.0.0

With a CDN

```html
<!-- It is recommended to replace the @latest with a strict version number for production -->
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/kyanite@latest/dist/kyanite.iife.min.js"></script>

<script>
  K.isEmpty({})
</script>
```

Or installing with `npm i kyanite` and then:

Standard module system

```js
// This will use the module path in the package.json (src/index.js)
import * as K from 'kyanite'
```

Common JS

```js
// For the prod minified version
const K = require('kyanite')
```

## Testing

Kyanite follows the [tap](http://testanything.org/) setup using the [tape](https://github.com/substack/tape) testing suite.

To run the tests:

- `git clone` the repo
- `cd` into the repo folder
- Run `npm i`
- Run `npm t`

## Credit

A lot of the if not most of the inspiration for this library came from 2 libraries I follow closely, Primarily most of it stems from:

- [foreword](https://github.com/abstract-tools/foreword) by [Abstract Tools](https://github.com/abstract-tools) which is a very nice and easy to use library developed by a close friend and mentor. This is where a lot of functionality ideas came from I can't recommend it enough.
- [Ramdajs](http://ramdajs.com/) by [Ramda](https://github.com/ramda) a beautiful and feature packed library where the original idea started
